## ADR-001: Smart Contracts vs Custom Blockchain

**Decision**: Smart Contracts.

**Rationale**: Smart contracts on established blockchains provide the necessary
functionality for our decentralized storytelling platform while significantly reducing
development complexity, security risks, and time-to-market.
Existing blockchains already offer robust consensus mechanisms,
established security, mature tooling, and scaling solutions that would
take years to develop independently. Our storytelling use case (voting,
chapter submission, and incentive distribution) fits well within the
capabilities of modern smart contract platforms without requiring custom
consensus algorithms or blockchain-level innovations.
