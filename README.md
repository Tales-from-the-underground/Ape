# Ape Storytelling

What are we trying to achieve?

Imagine a story which is not only written by a single author but by many. Authors
that are not simply friends or even know each other, they're random people whose
text contribution democratically was chosen to be inserted into the story.

Now, a certain story can go on while new chapters are being written, while some entity
(humans or AIs) is writting the next chapter. Meaning, it can go on for millions of years.

Anyone can suggest a new chapter to a given story.

Anyone can vote on chapter suggestions.

Anyone can read the story giving internet access and entities hosting the story
on a frontend. Or they can read by participating on the blockchain and pull from
there.

## Decentralized and consensus

No one control the storytelling data or processes.

Stories must live as long as there is someone to read or write to it, so in theory
they should exist and be appendable while there are consciouss beings hosting them.

That is the reason why it can not be controlled by a single or even by a group of
entities.

Therefore it must be hosted and processed on within a decentralized and permissionless
network.

Furthermore, we need consensus. Afterall, all nodes must agree on the state of each
story and the overall state of all data which includes entities votes.

... so using a blockchain is our only option.

## Economy

By the nature of using a blockchain, participating in the network, either voting
or suggesting chapters, will have a cost coming from transactions.

Now we have to talk about the costs inherently to participating on the storytelling.

To be honest, we're still not certain about how that will go.

However, probably both behaviors of voting and suggesting chapters will have a cost.

The money gathered will go to the chosen chapter author's wallet.
